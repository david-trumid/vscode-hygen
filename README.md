# Hygen for VSCode

This extension bundles [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/) into VSCode and offers seamless code generator functionality right into your editor.

## Usage

Main usage is through command pallete (Shift+Cmd+P) and search for 'Hygen'.

It's recommended to set a shortcut (but none is set by default).

For more information see the [Hygen website](http://www.hygen.io/).
